# Quadratic Equation Solver - JavaFX

This is a simple yet effective JavaFX application designed to solve quadratic equations of the form axÂ² + bx + c = 0. The application provides a user-friendly interface where you can input the coefficients 'a', 'b', and 'c' and receive the solutions, including real and complex roots.

## Features

-   **Intuitive UI:** A clean and user-friendly interface built with JavaFX.
-   **Real-time Calculation:**  Calculates the solutions of the quadratic equation instantly as coefficients are entered.
-   **Clear Results:** Displays real and complex roots in an understandable format.
-   **Error Handling:** Handles cases where the discriminant is negative and displays complex roots accordingly.
-   **Localized UI:** Designed with the Ukrainian language, making it more accessible for Ukrainian users.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TarStar12309/Quadratic-equation-solver-JavaFX-UA.git
